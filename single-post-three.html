<div class="post-title"><h2>Fathers, Take Up Responsibility!</h2>

<div class="the-author-name"><h3>Author: Fayiah S. Tamba</h3>
</div>

<div id="single-page-text-color">

<p>Since 2007 the world began to experience a serious economic crisis, the family has been greatly affected, as fathers cannot afford provisions for the home and mothers are gradually assuming the responsibility of the fathers.</p>

<p> A few years ago, I listened to an interview conducted with children at various gambling centers in my country, Liberia. Of all the responses gathered as to why they chose to gamble, a little child said, “We are in the street gambling because our fathers don’t have accounts for us.”</p>

<p> Many children are vulnerably roaming the streets because fathers have failed to take responsibility for the welfare of the family. Some fathers have willingly become liabilities to the family because their wives are doing part-time or full-time jobs.</p>

<p> Although the world is evolving, and mothers are securing job opportunities to help upkeep the financial status of the home, God never intended the mothers to be the sole winners of the home or family.</p>

<p> Genesis account reveals that God placed Adam in authority to look after the garden, as a father ought to care for his family. He was the breadwinner for his wife. God could not expect Adam to depend on his wife for provision. Rather, God Himself was Adam's utmost provider!</p>

<p> Nowadays, however, things are steadily changing about parental role and responsibility in the home. Because of modernization and what is termed as “gender equity,” fathers are losing control of their responsibility in the home. I do support the concept of gender equity but disagree that mothers completely take the role of the fathers in the home.</p>

<p> Designated as the helpmeet by God, mothers are to get involved in bringing up the children and make significant contributions to upkeep the home. But fathers should realize they are the heads and therefore must assume their responsibility for the welfare of the family.</p>

<p> When a father assumes the financial responsibility of his family, all other responsibilities like raising or disciplining children among others will fall into place. Children are sensitive to whether their fathers are capable of addressing their basic needs.</p>

<p> Failure on the fathers’ part, some children would disrespect or disobey their fathers. In the case of the child mentioned earlier, he justified his bad habit because of his father’s irresponsibility. He probably felt that his father was incapable of addressing his needs.</p>

<p> To this end, I suppose that one of the major factors contributing to poverty in Africa is because fathers have refused to take up responsibility.</p>

<p> According to the book, “Ye Fathers” David G. Burkholder observed that the definition of a father has been limited to someone who only brings forth children into the world; beyond this meaning, he further encouraged fathers to care for the welfare of the family. To take up financial responsibility in the home, I recommend fathers to do the following:</p><h3 class="paragraph-titles"> 1. Get a job and earn a salary that can sustain the family</h3>

<p> Before God presented Eve to Adam as his wife, Adam had a job which assumed a responsibility “to dress and to keep the garden” (Genesis 2:15).Adam could not have easily survived in the garden if he had not cultivated it well to produce good harvests.</p>

<p> Similarly, it is wise to have something doing before engaging in marriage. If a man is already married and doesn’t have a job, it is wiser and safer for him as a father to go out and find a job that would sustain him and the family.</p>

<p> No matter how much love wives and children may have for the fathers, if these fathers are not meeting up with their domestic roles, it is likely that they would lose their respect and ruin their integrity both in the home and society at large.</p><h3 class="paragraph-titles">2. Handle the finances wisely to sustain the family</h3>

<p> Fathers are to wisely use the resources for the family that comes to the home. Whatever comes to the fathers belongs to the home! I am obliged to say this because I have observed that not all irresponsible fathers are jobless.</p>

<p> Some fathers have lucrative jobs but cruelly refused to support their family. Their children have become gamblers and beggars in the streets and their wives have to carry the burdens of the family.</p>

<p> Undoubtedly, real fathers are blessings rather than burdens. They are not liabilities but great access. Considering this situation, fathers must take up responsibility in the home; and together the family would celebrate them as real fathers in our world.</p>
